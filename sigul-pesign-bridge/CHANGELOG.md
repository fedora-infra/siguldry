# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.5.0] - 2025-06-12

### Changed

- The `nix` dependency has been replaced with `rustix` (#44)

- The minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) is now 1.84 to align with RHEL 9.6 and 10.0 (#45)

- The `keys` section of the configuration file now has two additional required fields:
  `pesign_token_name` and `pesign_certificate_name`. These are used when looking up
  the key entry for a pesign-client request and the `key_name` and `certificate_name`
  fields are used when requesting the signature from Sigul. This allows the names in
  Sigul to be different from what pesign-client is aware of (#51)


## [0.4.0] - 2025-05-05

### Changed

- The `request_timeout_secs` configuration has been replaced by `total_request_timeout_secs`
  and `sigul_request_timeout_secs`. The total request timeout is the amount of time before
  an individual request is terminated. The sigul request timeout is the amount of time the
  bridge will wait for a Sigul request to succeed before canceling and retrying (#36)

- The default value of `total_request_timeout_secs` (previously `request_timeout_secs`) is now
  600 seconds and matches the documented default in `config.toml.example` (#36)


## [0.3.1] - 2025-03-24

### Fixed

- The example config.toml has been updated with the new `[sigul]` section (#29)


## [0.3.0] - 2025-03-13

### Changed

- The Python sigul client dependency has been replaced with the siguldry library (#26)

### Added

- It's possible to provide the `--credentials-directory` argument to the `config`
  sub-command to validate the files exist (#26).


## [0.2.1] - 2025-01-31

### Added

- An example configuration file (#24)

- The CLI manual page is now pre-built and checked into the repository (#23)

### Changed

- CI jobs now run with a restrictive set of default permissions (#22)


## [0.2.0] - 2025-01-16

### Added

- A changelog file.

- A cargo xtask to generate a manual page (#13).

- Two new CLI arguments which were previously undocumented environment variables:
  the `--log-filter` option is available on the root command and can also be specified
  with the `SIGUL_PESIGN_BRIDGE_LOG` environment variable. The `--credentials-directory`
  option is available on the `listen` sub-command and can be specified with the
  `CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY` environment variable (#20).

### Changed

- The config sub-command no longer checks that the configured secret files exist (#20).

- Invalid log configuration will cause the service to exit rather than being silently
  ignored (#12).

- The systemd unit now uses `ImportCredential=`, recommends storing secrets in
  `/etc/credstore.encrypted`, and recommends more idiomatic secret names (#15).

### Fixed

- Clarified the configuration documentation by explicitly noting what the Sigul
  configuration is (#17).

- The `request_timeout_secs` configuration now works as documented (#19).
